**For your project, focus on 6 core tasks:**
1. ✅ **Classification**: Inflation Regime
2. ✅ **Regression**: PP Multiplier (5Y)
3. ✅ **Time Series**: Price forecasting
4. ✅ **Clustering**: Asset grouping
5. ✅ **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA
6. ✅ **Recommendation**: Best Asset (5Y)

This covers all 6 required ML task types! 🎯

## 🎯 How Each Task Works (Simple Explanation)

### **1. Classification: Inflation Regime**
**What:** Predicts if inflation will be Low/Medium/High
**How:** Looks at Fed rate, money supply, unemployment → learns patterns like "when Fed raises rates fast + M2 drops = low inflation coming"

### **2. Regression: Purchasing Power Multiplier (5Y)**
**What:** Predicts exact number like "1.18x" (your $100 becomes $118)
**How:** Analyzes past 5-year returns, volatility, inflation correlation → calculates "based on current conditions, Gold typically returns 3.4%/year above inflation for 5 years = 1.18x"

### **3. Time Series: Price Forecasting**
**What:** Predicts Bitcoin price 30/90 days ahead
**How:** Studies price patterns over time → finds "prices usually rise after forming this pattern" or "following this trend, price heads to $X"

### **4. Clustering: Asset Grouping**
**What:** Groups similar assets together automatically
**How:** Measures how assets behave (returns, volatility, correlations) → discovers "Gold, Silver, Real Estate move together = inflation hedges" vs "Bitcoin, Tech stocks = high-risk growth"

### **5. Dimensionality Reduction: PCA**
**What:** Finds the 5-10 most important factors from 300+ features
**How:** Analyzes all features → discovers "90% of variation explained by just: inflation trend, Fed policy, market volatility, crypto momentum, traditional asset correlation"

### **6. Recommendation: Best Asset for 5 Years**
**What:** Says "buy Gold" or "buy Bitcoin" based on current situation
**How:** Compares all assets' expected 5-year performance → picks highest purchasing power multiplier adjusted for your risk tolerance → "For 5 years at medium risk, SP500 gives best 1.35x with acceptable volatility"

## 🔄 Complete Flow Example

**User:** "I want to invest for 5 years, inflation is 3.5%"

**Models work together:**

1. **Classification** → "Current regime: Medium inflation"
2. **Regression** → Calculates:
   - Gold: 1.18x
   - Bitcoin: 2.45x  
   - SP500: 1.35x
3. **Clustering** → "You're risk-moderate, Bitcoin is high-risk cluster"
4. **PCA** → "Key factors favor stocks over gold right now"
5. **Time Series** → "SP500 trend is positive for next year"
6. **Recommendation** → **"Buy SP500: 1.35x return, medium risk, best for 5-year horizon"**

**That's it.**
